Replacing Unity with XFCE in Ubuntu

Perform all of these as root in a terminal window, or prepend with sudo. (Look elsewhere for GUI steps 🙂 )

    Update your repos:

    apt-get update

    Uninstall Unity and ubuntu-desktop:

    apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop unity-*

    Install XFCE Desktop environment:

    apt-get install xubuntu-desktop

    Restart lightdm:

    /etc/init.d/lightdm restart

Voilà! You’re using XFCE desktop! 😉
